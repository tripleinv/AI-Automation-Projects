# AI automation

In this project, I utilized Python to harness AI's capabilities to automate routine financial and investment tasks. I've developed two key automations:

1. I used LangChain and OpenAI APIs to build a local chatbot for reading PDFs, making document search and scanning more efficient.
2. I also created an Excel reader that automatically extracts data from multiple Excel files and merges them into a single consolidated file, which is particularly useful for data summarization and consolidation.
